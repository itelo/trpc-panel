Although `trpc-panel` can provide a lot of value to developers as is, it is in it's infancy and there is a lot of room for improvement. The goal for this library is to make manual testing of trpc end backends as quick and easy as is possible, and to support the majority of trpc backends.

Right now, we're trying to get a better idea of community needs for this library and determine which features would be most valuable to trpc developers and anyone else who might want to use this UI. So, starting a discussion or opening an issue at [https://github.com/iway1/trpc-panel](https://github.com/iway1/trpc-panel) is a great way to contribute! Keep in mind the scope of this library is to build tRPC UIs.
